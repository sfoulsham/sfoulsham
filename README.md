## Hi, I'm Scarlett! <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px">

- I'm interested in data analytics and visualisations, especially when used to produce buisness insights!
- I'm currently studying computational data science at the University of Sydney.
- I'm learning about python, R, predictive modelling, and data manipulation.
- I love simplistic design and code and have incoporated that within my project work.
- I would love to hear any advice and feedback for my analytics work!
