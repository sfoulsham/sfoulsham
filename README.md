- I'm interested in data analytics and visualisations, especially when used to produce actionable buisness insights!
- I'm currently studying computational data science at the University of Sydney.
- I'm learning about python, R, predictive modelling, and data manipulation. 
- I'm looking to hear advice from other data science students and professionals.
- Please reach out if you have any advice or feedback!
